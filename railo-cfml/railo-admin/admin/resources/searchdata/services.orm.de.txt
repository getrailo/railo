If it is not set, Railo looks at the application directory, its sub-directories, and its mapped directories to search for persistent Comonents. This setting can be overwritten in Application.cfc as follows [this.ormsettings.cfclocation='...'] Creating Tables behavior Specifies whether Railo should automatically generate mapping for the persistent CFCs.
