 Define the component settings that will be used as a default for all web contexts.  Defines how components will be handled by Railo. Base/Root Component Please enter a value for the base/root component Every component that does not explicitly extend another component (attribute "extends") will by default extend this component. This means that every component extends this base component in some way. Auto Import Please enter a value for the auto import field the following package defintion is imported into every template. Search local Search relative to the caller directory for the component Search mappings Search the component in the mappings defined, this include the implicit mapping "/", that points on the webroot Search subdirectories 
	Search for CFCs in the subdirectories of the "Additional Resources" below (this does not work for Archives!) Cache component path is cached and not resolved again component path is cached and not resolved again Component "dump" template Please enter a value for the "dump" template If you call a component directly this template will be invoked to dump the component. (Example: http://www.railo.ch/ch/railo/common/Example.cfc) Data member access type private package public (CFML standard) remote Define the accessor for the data-members of a component. This defines how variables of the "this" scope of a component can be accessed from outside of the component. Implicit notation If there is no accessible data member (property, element of the this scope) inside a component, Railo searches for available matching &quot;getters&quot; or &quot;setters&quot; for the requested property. The following example should clarify this behaviour. &quot;somevar = myComponent.properyName&quot;. If &quot;myComponent&quot; has no accessible data member named &quot;propertyName&quot;, Railo searches for a function member (method) named &quot;getPropertyName&quot;. Variables scope Defines whether a component has an independent variables scope parallel to the &quot;this&quot; scope (CFML standard) or not. update cancel Reset to Server Administrator Setting Additional Resources Additional Resources that Railo checks for Components.
